/// About Version 7 ///

Version 7 contains 3 themes: LCARS Classic, LCARS Nemesis Blue, and LCARS Lower Decks. Each theme has 2 CSS files; the only difference is that one is a minified version. The HTML template page is linked to the minified CSS file. The non-minified CSS file is for you to explore and learn about the template, and to make it easier to edit and customize. I recommend that you note any changes or additions that you make to the CSS file in case of future updates.

News & updates about the template, including any future themes, are available in the LCARS logs at https://www.thelcars.com/logs/

*Attribution is included in the footer of the HTML page of each theme. You of course may include your own footer information, such as "Content copyright 2020 etc."
